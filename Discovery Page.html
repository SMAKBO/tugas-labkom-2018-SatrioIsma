	<h1> This is some kind of history from the Glyserol itself</h1>
	<h2> 	Two centuries ago in 1779, Carl W. Scheele, a Swedish chemist, was overjoyed when he discovered a new transparent, syrupy liquid by heating olive oil and litharge. Little did he know that this new chemical substance would soon become indispensable, through its various services, to mankind. This new sweet-tasting compound was named Glycerol (derived from the Greek word glykys, which means sweet). Studies later showed glycerol to be a principal component of all fats and oils, in the form of its esters called glycerides. Glycerol was found to possess a wide variety of uses in the manufacture of numerous domestic, industrial and pharmaceutical products. Today, the name glycerol refers to the pure chemical substance and is commercially known as glycerine.
Glycerol (CH2OH.CHOH.CH2OH), in its pure form, is a sweet-tasting, clear, colorless, odorless, viscous liquid. It is completely soluble in water and alcohols, slightly soluble in many common solvents like ether and dioxane and is insoluble in hydrocarbons. At low temperatures, glycerol sometimes forms crystals which tend to melt at 17.9° C. Liquid glycerol boils at 290° C under normal atmospheric pressure. Its specific gravity is 1.26 and its molecular weight is 92.09</h2>
